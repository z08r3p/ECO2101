DMSQF ECO2101 Microeconomics 
CA1 Individual Project - Instructions for Students 
July 2024 Semester (Jul - Sep 2024)
CA1 Individual Project Assessment 
This CA1 constitutes 30% of the overall   ECO2101   Microeconomics   course   assessment.
Rationale of Individual Project 
This   individual   project   allows   you to   pursue   authentic   learning   and to   apply theories taught   in   class   to   real   world   situations.   This   encourages   independence   and   self-confidence   as   well   as   developing   one’s thinking and analytical skills when working through   real   world   situations.
Choosing Product Market for Analysis 
This   project   involves choosing product(s) for   your   project   analysis,   using   microeconomics   concepts   discussed   in Lectures 1 to 5. 
The   product or service   market can   be either general   or   specific,   local,   or   international.
Some examples of   product or   service   market:
•            Smartphones   (general)
•          Apple iphone (specific brand   in   the   smartphone   market)
•          Starbuck   Coffee   in China   (local,   specific to   a   country)
•            Coffee   (international)
Choosing Articles as References for Analysis 
Search   through newspapers sources (other sources are strictly not permitted), either   in   print   or   online for THREE (3) articles based   on the   product   market you   have   chosen. Articles   should   contain real world situations. Articles that contain analysis   or   researched   by   others   should   not   be   used. The   articles   must   be   related to the concepts discussed   in Lectures 1 to 5.
Articles   must   be from 1st May 2024 onwards. 
The articles selected should   be in English and   based on   the   following   topics:   Article   1   -   Lecture Topic   1:   PPF   and   Opportunity Cost
Article 2 -   Lecture Topic 3:   Market   Equilibrium and   Efficiency   (Learning   and   understanding   Lecture   Topic 2:   Demand and Supply   is a   pre-requisite to   learning Topic   3)
Article 3 -   Lecture Topic 4:   Elasticities
OR 
-   Lecture Topic 5:   Utility and   Demand
Select    THREE       (3) articles on    the SAME PRODUCT (for      example,      all      3      articles      on      coffee) or DIFFERENT PRODUCTS (for   example,   1st      article   on   coffee,   2nd      article   on   apparel   and   3rd      article   on   smartphone).
Analysing your Product Market 
For each   article,   identify the event(s) or phenomena.    Summarise these events   in your   own   words.
Analyse   these   events   using   the   appropriate   microeconomic   concepts. Economic diagram(s),   where   applicable must be drawn to   support   your   analysis. Reproducing or paraphrasing the article does NOT constitute an analysis. 
The following are some suggestions for the   analysis:
Using   PPF concept to   analyse a   reduction   in the   production   of crops   due to   natural   disasters   like   earthquakes or flood   (lecture   1 topic; the   product can   be wheat or   coffee   or   cocoa)
Using   market   equilibrium   analysis   to   analyse   the   rise   of   price   of   oil   due   to   a   shortage   in   supply   or    excess    in    demand    (lecture      3    topic;      the      product      here      is      oil)      or      using      market      equilibrium   analysis to analyse the   changes   in the   price of semiconductor   chips   due   to   the   high   demand   and   reduced supply of semiconductor chips   (the   product   here is   semiconductor)   .
Using   price   elasticity   of   demand to   analyse   the   elasticity   of   oil   as   price   of   oil   rises   due   essential   needs    and    no    close    substitutability    or    shortage    in    supply      and    the      impact    on    the    consumer   expenditure on oil consumption   (lecture 4 topic; the   product   here   is   oil)
Using      utility    and    demand      to      analyse      on       household    consumption      choices       (lecture    5      topic:   income,   budget constraints and   utility)
Writing your Report 
Use Calibri Font Size 12pt.      Number your   pages.   Use single line spacing.   Do   a full justification (that is both left and right justified) of your   report.
The   report should   be   between   1,000 to   1,500 words.   Each Analysis should   have at   least   180 words.
Use the template   in Appendix 1 for your report format. 
•            Limit each   analysis to one   page.
•          Begin   each   analysis   on   a   new   page.   For   example,   analysis   2.1   on   a   new   page,   analysis   2.2   on   a   new   page,   and soon.
•          Ensure    consistency      throughout    the      report.      For    example,      consistent   formatting      (such      as   same font type and font size,   same   line   spacing) throughout   the   whole   report;   diagrams   are   all   drawn   using   the   same   software   代 写ECO2101 Microeconomics 2024R
代做程序编程语言such   as   Powerpoint   and   not   some   diagrams   are   drawn   using    PowerPoint    and    some    using    Word    or      Excel    software.             Diagrams    should    not    hand   drawn.
Report Grading 
This   is   a   short   report.   The   key   to   a   good   report   is   to   be clear and concise.   Report   will   be   graded   on   the      various       report       components,       namely       Introduction,       Article       Summary,       Analysis,         Diagrams,   Conclusion,   References   as well as   Report Consistency.
